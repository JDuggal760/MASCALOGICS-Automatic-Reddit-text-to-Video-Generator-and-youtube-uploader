bongozim: Shriners Hospitals Facts?
bongozim: Can any of my brothers in the shrine point me to some helpful facts about the hospitals and their care? My wife is trying to highlight a childrens charity every day for the next 100 days, we figured, why not start with Shriner's Children's Hospitals. If anyone has factual bullet points that she can use in her post it would be very helpful!!
NerdInTheWild: Contact the Shriners Hospital Public Relations office. They will be more than glad to answer any questions you may have. They also have pre made information packets they can send you.

Another option is to stop in your local Shrine. The office will have information on hand also.
